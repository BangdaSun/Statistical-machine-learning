This is the assignment of popular machine learning course on coursera.

### Assignment 1

#### 1. Familiar with Matlab
#### 2. Use gradient descent algorithm to implement linear regression
* Specify cost functions;

* Implement gradient descent: update the parameter using [learning rate] * [gradient of cost function to parameters]
(tips: use matrix form is easy to read);

* Compared with the closed form: use matrix representation; 

### Assignment 2

#### 1. Classification visualization
* Scatter plot;
* Decision boundary;

#### 2. Use gradient descent algorithm to implement logistics regression
* Cost function of logistics regression;

#### 3. Regularized logistics regression
* Mapping 2 features to 28 features;
* Use L2-norm regularization;

### Assignment 5

#### 1. Regularized linear regression
* Use L2-norm regularization;

#### 2. Bias-variance trade-off
* illustrated by polynomial regression;
* use cross validation to select optimal lambda (regularization parameter);

### Assignment 7

#### 1. Kmeans clustering algorithm
* Repeat two processes: find closest centroids and update centroids;
* Application in image compression;

#### 2. PCA
* Matrix operations related to PCA: SVD decomposition, projection and recovery;
