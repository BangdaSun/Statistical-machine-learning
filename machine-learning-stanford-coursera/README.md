This is the assignment of popular machine learning course on coursera.

### Assignment 1

#### 1. Familiar with Matlab
#### 2. Use gradient descent algorithm to implement linear regression
* Specify cost functions;

* Implement gradient descent: update the parameter using [learning rate] * [gradient of cost function to parameters]
(tips: use matrix form is easy to read);

* Compared with the closed form: use matrix representation;
